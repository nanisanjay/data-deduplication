## Calculate TFIDF and Cosine Similarity

### Overview
1. Preprocess articles (word tokenize, remove stop words, remove punctuation, conduct stemming*)
2. Calculate tf-idf for each term
3. Calculate pairwise cosine similarity for the documents

\*Porter stemming was used for stemming

### How to use
1. place `cosine_similarity_tfidf_nltk.py` in a directory at the same level as `inputdata/`
2. run `python cosine_similarity_tfidf_nltk.py`
NOTE: you may need to install NLTK and download some of it's packages. You can do this by running a python script, importing nltk, then calling `nltk.download()` which will open a GUI.  This script is not intended for many or large files.
